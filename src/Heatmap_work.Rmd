## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import, message=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("data (copy)/birdstrikes_clean.csv")
df['one'] = 1
head(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = year, y = state)) +
  geom_tile(data = df %>% group_by(year, state) %>% summarize(count = n()),aes(fill = count)) #+
 # scale_fill_gradient(low = "#ccffcc",  high = "navyblue")
```
```{r}

```

```{r}
make_heatmap_plot(y_var, dmg_lvl){
  dmg_vect <- vector()
  for(i in dmg_lvl){
    dmg_vect <- c(dmg_vect, i) 
  }
  
  if(length(dmg_vect) != 0 ){
    h_plot <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = year, y = state)) +
    geom_tile(data = df %>% group_by(year, state) %>% summarize(count = n()), aes(fill = count))
    
  }
  
  heatmap <- ggplot(.....)
}
```
```{r}
a = c(1,2,3)
length(a)
```

```{r}
df %>% group_by(damage_level) %>% summarize(count = n())

```
